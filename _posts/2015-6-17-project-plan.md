##I was kidding

Remember when I said I was doing an experiment on ceiling fans? Well, I lied. I actually doing one on soil moisture and irrigation systems. I'm looking at soil moisture sensors to completely automate the system. My first test will be my own house.

Here are some things I need

4 $15-$30 wireless soil-moisture, humdity sensors

golang weather integration api

rasberry pi

irrigation system


I would write a golang program on the pi to integrate information from the weather and soil moisture sensors to control the irrigation system to save water/make the lawn look good.
