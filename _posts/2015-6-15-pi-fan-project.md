##I Found An Idea

I've been struggling to work consistently over the last week. However, I think I've found a good idea to work on. Testing the energy used by ceiling fans opposed to air conditioning. I'm trying to see if there is any research done on the subject, but I think my Raspi will allow me to track this data and store it as an experiment. I hope to create a report of this data.
