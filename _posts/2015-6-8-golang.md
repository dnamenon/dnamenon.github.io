I'm really starting to focus on goloang. Right now I'm following a tutorial on a how to make a chatroom in golang. It's a pretty great tutorial by <a href= "https://github.com/jakecoffman">Jake Coffman</a>. You can find it <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysAZ_oqPOo0">here</a>. I think this app is great for for beginners learning to use go's internet backend.
